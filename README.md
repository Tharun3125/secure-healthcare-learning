My daily learning journey in FHIR interoperability, Azure security, and system design thinking.


# Secure Healthcare Learning Journey

This repository documents my daily learning and practical understanding of:

- Healthcare Interoperability (HL7 & FHIR)
- Cloud & API Security (Azure focused)
- System Design Thinking
- Python Data Structures & Algorithms

## Goal
To become a Healthcare Cloud Engineer capable of designing secure interoperability systems.

I am learning in public by documenting concepts I actually understand — not copied notes.

## Structure

security/ → Networking, authentication, authorization, cloud security  
fhir/ → Resource modeling and healthcare interoperability
